Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation:
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

Example 2:

Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]

Example 3:

Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.

Example 4:

Input: target = [2,3,4], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]

Constraints:

    1 <= target.length <= 100
    1 <= target[i] <= 100
    1 <= n <= 100
    target is strictly increasing.
